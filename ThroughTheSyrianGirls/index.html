			    		Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland depicts a young girl who is suddenly thrown into an alien world. She finds herself lost, confused, and mistreated in an environment where everything from time to language is warped. She tries her best to maneuver and find a place in Wonderland, but faces many conflicts. This occurrence of a child being forced into a foreign world transcends fiction. Today, the Syrian Civil War has caused millions of refugees to seek homes in foreign lands. This inevitably includes young girls who have had to leave country they know. In escaping the war, they find themselves far from home, overcoming numerous obstacles just to survive. </br></span><a href="workscited.html" target= "_blank">11</a>

				    		A particular issue concerning young Syrian girls being forced into marriages. Impoverished parents often see no other choice for their daughters. According to the University of St. Joseph, 6 percent of Syrian refugee girls in Lebanon are being married before turning 18. At the age of 13, Nour is one of these girls. Four years ago, she and her family fled Syria. She now lives in Lebanon with her 27-year-old husband. According to Nour’s parents, “If it wasn’t for the war, we could never have allowed our daughter to get married so young, but now we cannot keep her because of our economic problems.” <a href="workscited.html" target="_blank"> 1, 8</a></br>

Their father, not seen in a year, is most likely dead. In an interview, Hala’s brother states, “Hala was like any other kid, she went to school, she played, life was normal.

She stated, “I felt deep sadness when we left Syria. I left everything, my friends, my possessions-everything I had.”  After boarding a bus, Omaymah remembers, “In the bus I was scared and sad because I left my country, I was scared of the future and worried about being a refugee.” Upon traveling to Jordan, their bus was attacked but they eventually arrived in Zaatari. At the time, Omaymah believed that their stay would only be 6 months and that they could soon return to Syria. Omaymah enrolled in school, which she claims is the only thing she likes about the refugee camp. She hopes to become doctor or engineer and wants to help contribute to her country. Though, she worries that she won’t be able to attend university because of the fees and lack of opportunities. Despite the amount of time it’ll take, her biggest wish now is to return back home to Syria. </br> <a href="workscited.html" target="_blank"> 6 </a>
